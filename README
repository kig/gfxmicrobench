Web Graphics Microbenchmarks
----------------------------

Proposed goals:
 * Give web developers specific information on graphics performance
 * Measure the graphics performance of the current client
   * Use to scale graphics fidelity (screen size, amount of details)
   * Use to pick the best-performing rendering path
 * Give browser devs a set of measures to judge browser graphics performance
 * No server component required

Plan:
 * Benchmark very small features (e.g. drawImage /w no transform and aligned 
   to canvas grid, drawImage /w transform, clipped drawImage, etc.)
 * Make a short version (~1-2s runtime) of the benchmark suite for figuring
   out the performance of the current client. Run the bm at page load time, 
   e.g. when displaying a "Loading..." splash.

Timeline:
 * Start in mid-May.
